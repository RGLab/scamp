Description: This package implements selective clustering annotated using modes of projections (SCAMP).
    The scamp function can be used to cluster real-valued data matrices.
    This package builds of the work of many others.
    Its source contains modified files (conveyances) from the following R packages:
    "Ckmeans.1d.dp", by Joe Song and Haizhou Wang;
    "diptest" by Martin Maechler;
    "ftnonpar" by Laurie Davies and Arne Kovac.
    It also contains ports of functions from those packages.
    In addition, it ports a function from: "lmom" by J. R. M. Hosking.
