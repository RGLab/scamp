The shell script runScenario.sh is used to launch half the jobs in a single simulation scenario.

The simulation was run on a computing cluster using slurm.

Slurm settings are controlled in runSimulation.sh

The R scripts should be run in numeric order

note: if number of threads changed, results may not match paper exactly.
however, the results should be very similar.
this is because the random candidate cluster search allows all launched
threads to finish after the maximumClusterNum threshold has been crossed.
each launched thread increments the random seed, and so
modifying the threads parameter will affect all subsequent scamp iterations.
