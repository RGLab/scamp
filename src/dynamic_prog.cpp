/*
 * This program was modified by Evan Greene <egreene@fredhutch.org> on August 1, 2017.
 * The modification significantly reduced the functionality of this program, extracting the 
 * parts of the library used for 1-dimensional k-medians. The R-interface was removed,
 * since the reduction in functionality was to integrate this routine into the scamp package.
 * I belive that makes it a derived work according to GPL-3.
 * For the full functionality, download the R package "Ckmeans.1d.dp", by Joe Song and Haizhou Wang from CRAN.
 * Their comments are left in full at the head of the file.
